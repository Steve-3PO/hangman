# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 2

### What have you built?
<ul>
    <li>To initialise my code I have created a simple list of fruit to randomly select from to generate the hangman guesses. This will be changed once tested and runs effectively. After this a guess is taken from the user and it is checked if it is valid.</li>
</ul>
    
### What technologies have you used?
<ul>
    <li>Besides the Random library, no technologies have been implemented yet in this stage of the project.</li>
</ul>
    
### Why have you used those?
<ul>
    <li>The Random library will be useful in generating a random word from a finite list for the purpose of building this project initially. However this should be replaced with a wider approach.</li>
</ul>


## Milestone 3

### What have you built?
<ul>
    <li>In this milestone I have developed from the previous a function to check whether an input guess is valid from the user, which subsequently calls another function to see whether the guess is within the randomly generated word</li>
</ul>
    
### What technologies have you used?
<ul>
    <li>A good understanding of conditions and loops are required to continually request inputs from the user when there is an unexpected input</li>
</ul>
    
### Why have you used those?
<ul>
    <li>These allow us to refine the code so that it can continually check that the users input meets the required conditions before making a check.</li>
</ul>


## Milestone 4

### What have you built?
<ul>
    <li>In milestone 4, appropriate actions are taken for when guesses are within the selected word or not. Reducing lives, updating the guessed_word string and appending to the bank of attempted letters</li>
</ul>
    
### What technologies have you used?
<ul>
    <li>A Hangman Class has been utilised in this current milestone. </li>
</ul>
    
### Why have you used those?
<ul>
    <li>A Class with allow us to assign all functions and call them in a more susinct way, tying everything back to the Hangman Class. This will also allow users to create multiple instances of the game.</li>
</ul>


## Milestone 5

### What have you built?
<ul>
    <li>The game has been polished and bugs have been ironed out. The game now runs smoothly allowing for further expansion on the list of words given or the mechanics of finding any word from a dictionary, not just from a finite list preprovided</li>
</ul>
