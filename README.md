# Hangman (AiCore training)

## Overview 
> - This is an implitation of the classic Hangman game, where the computer will generate a word and the user tries to guess it within a certain amount of attempts. 

## Learning Objectives
> - To utilise OOP principles to build the game
> - To implement good python practise and coding

## Project Structure

### Milestone 1 - "Create the Variables for the Game"
> - Define list of possible words
> - Select a random word from list
> - Ask user for input
> - Validate user input

### Milestone 2 - "Check if the Guessed Character is in the Word"
> - Iteratively check for valid user input
> - Check if guess in word
> - Create functions to run checks

### Milestone 3 - "Create the Game Class"
> - Create the class
> - Create methods for running checks
> -  Define what happens if letter is/not in word

### Milestone 4 - "Putting it all Together"
> - Code the logic of the game




## M1 - "Create the Variables for the Game"

The first variable to define is the list of words that the computer can select. In the normal game of Hangman there are no limits to what can be chosen however to test the code, a small list of 5 elements, ```word_list```, is used so that computation and testing can be swift.



## M2 - "Check if the Guessed Character is in the Word"







## M3 - "Create the Game Class"



## M4 - "Putting it all Together"
