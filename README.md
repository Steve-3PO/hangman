# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 1

<ul>
    <li>**What have you built?**</li>
        <p>To initialise my code I have created a simple list of fruit to randomly select from to generate the hangman guesses. This will be changed once tested and runs effectively. After this a guess is taken from the user and it is checked if it is valid.</p>
    <li>**What technologies have you used?**</li>
        <p>Besides the Random library, no technologies have been implemented yet in this stage of the project</p>
    <li>**Why have you used those?**</li>
        <p>The Random library will be useful in generating a random word from a finite list for the purpose of building this project initially. However this should be replaced with a wider approach.</p>
