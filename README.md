# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 1

<ul>
    What have you built?
        <li>To initialise my code I have created a simple list of fruit to randomly select from to generate the hangman guesses. This will be changed once tested and runs effectively. After this a guess is taken from the user and it is checked if it is valid.</li>

    What technologies have you used?
        <li>Besides the Random library, no technologies have been implemented yet in this stage of the project</li>

    Why have you used those?
        <li>The Random library will be useful in generating a random word from a finite list for the purpose of building this project initially. However this should be replaced with a wider approach.</li>
